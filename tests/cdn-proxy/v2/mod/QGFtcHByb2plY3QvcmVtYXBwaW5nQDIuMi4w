   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

> Remap sequential sourcemaps through transformations to point at the original source code

Remapping allows you to take the sourcemaps generated through transforming your code and "remap"
them to the original source locations. Think "my minified code, transformed with babel and bundled
with webpack", all pointing to the correct location in your original source code.

With remapping, none of your source code transformations need to be aware of the input's sourcemap,
they only need to generate an output sourcemap. This greatly simplifies building custom
transformations (think a find-and-replace).

## Installation

```sh
npm install @ampproject/remapping
```

## Usage

```typescript
function remapping(
  map: SourceMap | SourceMap[],
  loader: (file: string, ctx: LoaderContext) => (SourceMap | null | undefined),
  options?: { excludeContent: boolean, decodedMappings: boolean }
): SourceMap;

// LoaderContext gives the loader the importing sourcemap, tree depth, the ability to override the
// "source" location (where child sources are resolved relative to, or the location of original
// source), and the ability to override the "content" of an original source for inclusion in the
// output sourcemap.
type LoaderContext = {
 readonly importer: string;
 readonly depth: number;
 source: string;
 content: string | null | undefined;
}
```

`remapping` takes the final output sourcemap, and a `loader` function. For every source file pointer
in the sourcemap, the `loader` will be called with the resolved path. If the path itself represents
a transformed file (it has a sourcmap associated with it), then the `loader` should return that
sourcemap. If not, the path will be treated as an original, untransformed source code.

```js
// Babel transformed "helloworld.js" into "transformed.js"
const transformedMap = JSON.stringify({
  file: 'transformed.js',
  // 1st column of 2nd line of output file translates into the 1st source
  // file, line 3, column 2
  mappings: ';CAEE',
  sources: ['helloworld.js'],
  version: 3,
});

// Uglify minified "transformed.js" into "transformed.min.js"
const minifiedTransformedMap = JSON.stringify({
  file: 'transformed.min.js',
  // 0th column of 1st line of output file translates into the 1st source
  // file, line 2, column 1.
  mappings: 'AACC',
  names: [],
  sources: ['transformed.js'],
  version: 3,
});

const remapped = remapping(
  minifiedTransformedMap,
  (file, ctx) => {

    // The "transformed.js" file is an transformed file.
    if (file === 'transformed.js') {
      // The root importer is empty.
      console.assert(ctx.importer === '');
      // The depth in the sourcemap tree we're currently loading.
      // The root `minifiedTransformedMap` is depth 0, and its source children are depth 1, etc.
      console.assert(ctx.depth === 1);

      return transformedMap;
    }

    // Loader will be called to load transformedMap's source file pointers as well.
    console.assert(file === 'helloworld.js');
    // `transformed.js`'s sourcemap points into `helloworld.js`.
    console.assert(ctx.importer === 'transformed.js');
    // This is a source child of `transformed`, which is a source child of `minifiedTransformedMap`.
    console.assert(ctx.depth === 2);
    return null;
  }
);

console.log(remapped);
// {
//   file: 'transpiled.min.js',
//   mappings: 'AAEE',
//   sources: ['helloworld.js'],
//   version: 3,
// };
```

In this example, `loader` will be called twice:

1. `"transformed.js"`, the first source file pointer in the `minifiedTransformedMap`. We return the
   associated sourcemap for it (its a transformed file, after all) so that sourcemap locations can
   be traced through it into the source files it represents.
2. `"helloworld.js"`, our original, unmodified source code. This file does not have a sourcemap, so
   we return `null`.

The `remapped` sourcemap now points from `transformed.min.js` into locations in `helloworld.js`. If
you were to read the `mappings`, it says "0th column of the first line output line points to the 1st
column of the 2nd line of the file `helloworld.js`".

### Multiple transformations of a file

As a convenience, if you have multiple single-source transformations of a file, you may pass an
array of sourcemap files in the order of most-recent transformation sourcemap first. Note that this
changes the `importer` and `depth` of each call to our loader. So our above example could have been
written as:

```js
const remapped = remapping(
  [minifiedTransformedMap, transformedMap],
  () => null
);

console.log(remapped);
// {
//   file: 'transpiled.min.js',
//   mappings: 'AAEE',
//   sources: ['helloworld.js'],
//   version: 3,
// };
```

### Advanced control of the loading graph

#### `source`

The `source` property can overridden to any value to change the location of the current load. Eg,
for an original source file, it allows us to change the location to the original source regardless
of what the sourcemap source entry says. And for transformed files, it allows us to change the
relative resolving location for child sources of the loaded sourcemap.

```js
const remapped = remapping(
  minifiedTransformedMap,
  (file, ctx) => {

    if (file === 'transformed.js') {
      // We pretend the transformed.js file actually exists in the 'src/' directory. When the nested
      // source files are loaded, they will now be relative to `src/`.
      ctx.source = 'src/transformed.js';
      return transformedMap;
    }

    console.assert(file === 'src/helloworld.js');
    // We could futher change the source of this original file, eg, to be inside a nested directory
    // itself. This will be reflected in the remapped sourcemap.
    ctx.source = 'src/nested/transformed.js';
    return null;
  }
);

console.log(remapped);
// {
//   ‚Ä¶,
//   sources: ['src/nested/helloworld.js'],
// };
```


#### `content`

The `content` property can be overridden when we encounter an original source file. Eg, this allows
you to manually provide the source content of the original file regardless of whether the
`sourcesContent` field is present in the parent sourcemap. It can also be set to `null` to remove
the source content.

```js
const remapped = remapping(
  minifiedTransformedMap,
  (file, ctx) => {

    if (file === 'transformed.js') {
      // transformedMap does not include a `sourcesContent` field, so usually the remapped sourcemap
      // would not include any `sourcesContent` values.
      return transformedMap;
    }

    console.assert(file === 'helloworld.js');
    // We can read the file to provide the source content.
    ctx.content = fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf8');
    return null;
  }
);

console.log(remapped);
// {
//   ‚Ä¶,
//   sourcesContent: [
//     'console.log("Hello world!")',
//   ],
// };
```

### Options

#### excludeContent

By default, `excludeContent` is `false`. Passing `{ excludeContent: true }` will exclude the
`sourcesContent` field from the returned sourcemap. This is mainly useful when you want to reduce
the size out the sourcemap.

#### decodedMappings

By default, `decodedMappings` is `false`. Passing `{ decodedMappings: true }` will leave the
`mappings` field in a [decoded state](https://github.com/rich-harris/sourcemap-codec) instead of
encoding into a VLQ string.
